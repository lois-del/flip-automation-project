#Business Rules – Withdrawal Charge Tracker
##Product Overview
The modified FLIP product maintains the same name but introduces new business logic, including a unique product code. While the core banking system lacked full support for the updated rules, a custom-built solution was developed prior to go-live to enable branches to provide accurate and consistent customer advice.

##Key Business Rules
1. **Investment Period**
The minimum investment period is 5 years, with automatic roll-over at the end of each term.

Investments continue to accrue interest unless action is taken by the customer to terminate or withdraw.

2. **Withdrawal Rules**
One Partial Withdrawal per Year:
FLIP account holders may request one partial withdrawal per calendar year without incurring any penalty.

Additional Withdrawals Within the Same Year:
If more than one partial withdrawal is made in a year, a Partial Withdrawal Fee of 0.25% of the withdrawal amount is charged on each subsequent withdrawal.

Withdrawals Upon Maturity:
No charges apply when withdrawals are made upon rollover/maturity.

Charge Calculation Logic
When a charge is applicable, it is calculated as:
Charge = Withdrawal Amount × 0.0025

Allowable Withdrawal Calculation
The solution dynamically determines:
-Whether a partial withdrawal has already occurred in the current year
-If the request is penalty-free or chargeable
-The applicable charge (if any)

**Reporting**
Business Objects reports made these insights accessible at branch level, displaying:
- Investment start and maturity dates
- Withdrawal history for the calendar year
- Eligibility status for withdrawal (based on withdrawal amount)
- Chargeable amount
